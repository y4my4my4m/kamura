### load maps

would be nice to have levels designs like this:

```
00 - ( [0] first bit is tiletype [0] second bit is the file type index )
00 - ( [0] walk through		 [0] invisible sprite )
01 - ( [0] walk through		 [1] grass sprite )
12 - ( [1] swim			 [2] water sprite )
23 - ( [2] blocked		 [3] brick sprite )
34 - ( [3] damage		 [4] fire  sprite )

( and so on... )
```
